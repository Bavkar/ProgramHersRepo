    <h1>Hello! My name is Aadhya.</h1>
    <p>I am an incoming 8th grader at DATA Middle School, and I live in Ventura, California. I've been <i>so</i> bored during quarantine, 
    but everybody in the world has to deal with it at the same time, and I'm pretty surprised how much <u>humanity</u> has kicked in. Just
doing simple good deeds around your neighborhood and showing support for <b>healthcare workers</b> can do <i>wonders</i>. Keep up the good
work people!</p>
